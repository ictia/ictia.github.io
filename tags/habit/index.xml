      <description>A habit is something that a person does often, in a regular and repeated way.&#xA;A routine is a specific set of habits done in a particular order.&#xA;For instance, a regular morning routine could be: wake up, go to the toilet, brush your teeth, get dressed, eat breakfast, drink coffee, go out the door. The whole is a routine, the individual aspects are habits.&#xA;If your days are more or less the same every day, with perhaps some deviation over the weekend, then you have a daily routine.</description>
