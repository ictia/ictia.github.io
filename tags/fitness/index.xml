      <description>Endurance cycling is a sport that requires a high level of cardiovascular fitness and endurance. One of the most effective ways to improve these areas is through zone 2 training.
Zone 2 training, also known as aerobic training, involves working at a moderate intensity level where the body is able to use oxygen to produce energy. This type of training is specific to endurance sports like cycling, where the goal is to maintain a steady pace for long periods of time.</description>

      <title>High Intensity Interval Training</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/hiit/</link>

      <description>This is a form of workout where you switch between short periods of intense exercise and brief periods of recovery. Most of the time the intense periods are between 30 seconds and up to 5 minutes. The level of intensity during every interval should in principle be &amp;lsquo;all-out&amp;rsquo;, you will be reaching your VO2Max and anaerobic zone.
Although HIIT is all the craze nowadays it should not be taken lightly, and only considered after you have completed a good base period and your body has properly adapted and is ready for more intensive workouts.</description>

      <title>Steady State Training</title>

      <description>Steady state training is the opposite of HIIT. It requires maintaining a specific heart rate below the maximum of your targeted zone for an extended period of time. Simply stated, it is a cardio workout that calls for a continuous and steady effort, whereas an HIIT workout requires a varying energy output.
Benefits great for beginners starting out on a workout routine less stress on muscles and joints helps in recovery after harder workouts like HIIT it helps to improve endurance and conditioning without too much stress on the body Pros and Cons As a steady state workout is usually done at a low to moderate intensity, workouts tend to be longer.</description>

      <title>Make exercise a habit and part of a routine</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/habit_routine/</link>

      <description>A habit is something that a person does often, in a regular and repeated way.
A routine is a specific set of habits done in a particular order.
For instance, a regular morning routine could be: wake up, go to the toilet, brush your teeth, get dressed, eat breakfast, drink coffee, go out the door. The whole is a routine, the individual aspects are habits.
If your days are more or less the same every day, with perhaps some deviation over the weekend, then you have a daily routine.</description>

      <title>Training zones</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/training-zones/</link>

      <description>What are training zones? Training zones are basically exercise intensity levels, and the period within each has a direct effect on how productive your training is. Different types of exercises determine for how long you should ideally train within each zone. Simply put, if you are training for endurance then the lower end training zones are your goal, if sudden, high-speed, explosive break-aways are your thing, then you will need to train more often in the higher end training zones.</description>

      <title>Heart rates</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/heart-rates/</link>

      <description>Knowing your heart rate data points is the best way to establish your training zones. However, they are neither easy to define nor to measure.
Definitions Heart rate: your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute at any given moment. Heart rates vary from person to person. It’s lower when you’re at rest and higher when you exercise.
MHR = Maximum Heart Rate: literally the maximum number of beats per minute your heart can reach during an all-out strenuous exercise.</description>

      <title>Rating of Perceived Exertion - RPE</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/rpe/</link>

      <description>Ideally you would measure exercise intensity by monitoring your heart rate. However, not everyone has a heart rate monitor readily available. You could measure it by stopping and taking your pulse at regular intervals&amp;hellip;But, there is an alternative that works remarkably well: the Rating of Perceived Exertion, or RPE, also known as the Borg scale.
A Rating of Perceived Exertion is perhaps the most basic way to express the intensity you are experiencing during an exercise, and yet for all its simplicity, it has great value.</description>

      <title>What is Cardio?</title>

      <description>Simply put, a cardiovascular exercise or cardio is an exercise that elevates your heart and breathing rates - effectively pumps your heart rate up to 60% - 70% of its maximum - for at least 20 minutes, improving your heart, lungs, and circulatory system.
Types of Cardio Steady State (SS)
Exercising at a continuous, steady effort.
High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
Switching between short periods of intense exercise and brief periods of recovery.</description>
