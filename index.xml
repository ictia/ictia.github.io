      <title>Diet or lifestyle change?</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/diet-lifestyle/</link>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s really very simple:
 A diet is temporary, a lifestyle change is for ever.
 When you are on a diet you temporarily change your eating habits to achieve a certain outcome - most commonly weight loss - before returning to your previous eating habits.
A lifestyle change however, consists of adopting healthy overall habits that promote long-term health and weight control. Further more, diets focus on food intake, while lifestyle changes combine what you eat along with other factors that affect your overall health, such as physical activity.</description>

      <title>Motivational quotes</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/quotes/</link>

      <description>Sometimes you need a bit of motivation. I don&amp;rsquo;t always want to go outside and ride, even knowing that after 20 - 30 minutes I usually can&amp;rsquo;t fathom why I didn&amp;rsquo;t go out earlier. When I need a pick-me-up, I tend to watch a few motivational videos by Jocko Willink and David Goggins telling me to get my shit together and get after it. It works.
Arthur Conan Doyle     When the spirits are low, when the day appears dark, when work becomes monotonous, when hope hardly seems worth having, just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road, without thought on anything but the ride you are taking.</description>

      <title>Training zones</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/training-zones/</link>

      <description>What are training zones?    Training zones are basically exercise intensity levels, and the period within each has a direct effect on how productive your training is. Different types of exercises determine for how long you should ideally train within each zone. Simply put, if you are training for endurance then the lower end training zones are your goal, if sudden, high-speed, explosive break-aways are your thing, then you will need to train more often in the higher end training zones.</description>

      <title>Heart rates</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/heart-rates/</link>

      <description>Knowing your heart rate data points is the best way to establish your training zones. However, they are neither easy to define nor to measure.
Definitions    Heart rate: your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute at any given moment. Heart rates vary from person to person. It’s lower when you’re at rest and higher when you exercise.
MHR = Maximum Heart Rate: literally the maximum number of beats per minute your heart can reach during an all-out strenuous exercise.</description>

      <title>Rating of Perceived Exertion - RPE</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/rpe/</link>

      <description>Ideally you would measure exercise intensity by monitoring your heart rate. However, not everyone has a heart rate monitor readily available. You could measure it by stopping and taking your pulse at regular intervals&amp;hellip;But, there is an alternative that works remarkably well: the Rating of Perceived Exertion, or RPE, also known as the Borg scale.
A Rating of Perceived Exertion is perhaps the most basic way to express the intensity you are experiencing during an exercise, and yet for all its simplicity, it has great value.</description>

      <title>Make exercise a habit and part of a routine</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/habit_routine/</link>

      <description>A habit is something that a person does often, in a regular and repeated way.
A routine is a specific set of habits done in a particular order.
For instance, a regular morning routine could be: wake up, go to the toilet, brush your teeth, get dressed, eat breakfast, drink coffee, go out the door. The whole is a routine, the individual aspects are habits.
If your days are more or less the same every day, with perhaps some deviation over the weekend, then you have a daily routine.</description>

      <link>https://ictia.github.io/posts/cardio/</link>

      <guid>https://ictia.github.io/posts/cardio/</guid>
      <description>Simply put, a cardiovascular exercise or cardio is an exercise that elevates your heart and breathing rates - effectively pumps your heart rate up to 60% - 70% of its maximum - for at least 20 minutes, improving your heart, lungs, and circulatory system.
Types of Cardio      Steady State (SS)
Exercising at a continuous, steady effort.
  High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
Switching between short periods of intense exercise and brief periods of recovery.</description>

      <title>Why the bicycle?</title>

      <description>I come from a cycling nation, so the bicycle is always high on my mind.
Compared to running, cycling has far less impact on your joints, namely knees and hips, it feels less strenuous yet is a great vehicle for improving your health.
Cycling relaxes my mind, after a while, and certainly out in the countryside, it wanders off into all kinds of new and interesting directions. A good exercise brings peace of mind.</description>

      <title>From Finland to the Netherlands by bicycle</title>

      <description>One could say that I grew up cycling. Some of my earlier memories are of me learning to cycle in Purmerend, 20 kilometers or so to the north of Amsterdam. I remember later on trying to break my speed records while checking my speedometer, which at the time (the early 1970s) was a large handlebar mounted contraption. During my teens I road-raced and I have basically enjoyed cycling my whole life.</description>
