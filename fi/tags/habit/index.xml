      <description>&lt;p&gt;A habit is something that a person does often, in a regular and repeated way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A routine is a specific set of habits done in a particular order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a regular morning routine could be: wake up, go to the toilet, brush your teeth, get dressed, eat breakfast, drink coffee, go out the door. The whole is a routine, the individual aspects are habits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your days are more or less the same every day, with perhaps some deviation over the weekend, then you have a daily routine. A common one would be: wake up, breakfast, go to work, lunch, more work, go home, dinner, watch TV, go to sleep. Day in, day out&amp;hellip; More specific, however, your daily routine, will consist of multiple shorter routines: morning routine, daytime routine, and evening routine, each containing various habits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
