      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cycling has become an increasingly popular form of transportation and exercise. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned pro or just starting out, navigation apps can be a great tool to help you plan and navigate your routes. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a closer look at some of the cycling navigation apps and sites. The focus is the importing of GPX files, for instance routes downloaded from the Lake Trails’ website, and on mobile friendly solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Endurance cycling is a sport that requires a high level of cardiovascular fitness and endurance. One of the most effective ways to improve these areas is through zone 2 training.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zone 2 training, also known as aerobic training, involves working at a moderate intensity level where the body is able to use oxygen to produce energy. This type of training is specific to endurance sports like cycling, where the goal is to maintain a steady pace for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fartlek</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fartlek training is a popular and effective method of training for endurance cycling. The name &amp;ldquo;fartlek&amp;rdquo; comes from the Swedish word for &amp;ldquo;speed play,&amp;rdquo; which is an accurate description of this type of training. The idea behind fartlek training is to incorporate bursts of high-intensity effort into a moderate-intensity workout.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the main benefits of fartlek training is that it improves cardiovascular fitness. The high-intensity bursts of effort challenge the body to work harder, which in turn increases the size and strength of the heart and lungs. This leads to better oxygen delivery to working muscles, which can improve endurance and overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>High Intensity Interval Training</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/hiit/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 08:28:20 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/hiit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a form of workout where you switch between short periods of intense exercise and brief periods of recovery. Most of the time the intense periods are between 30 seconds and up to 5 minutes. The level of intensity during every interval should in principle be &amp;lsquo;all-out&amp;rsquo;, you will be reaching your VO2Max and anaerobic zone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although HIIT is all the craze nowadays it should not be taken lightly, and only considered after you have completed a good base period and your body has properly adapted and is ready for more intensive workouts. Without proper preparation HIIT can easily lead to overloading and burnout. Given its higher intensity you will need more time to recover after an HIIT workout, you need to be perfectly rested and “fresh” before every one of this kind of workouts so you can fully reap the benefits,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Steady State Training</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steady state training is the opposite of HIIT. It requires maintaining a specific heart rate below the maximum of your targeted zone for an extended period of time. Simply stated, it is a cardio workout that calls for a continuous and steady effort, whereas an HIIT workout requires a varying energy output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Benefits&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#benefits&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;great for beginners starting out on a workout routine&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;less stress on muscles and joints&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;helps in recovery after harder workouts like HIIT&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it helps to improve endurance and conditioning without too much stress on the body&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pros-and-cons&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Pros and Cons&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#pros-and-cons&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a steady state workout is usually done at a low to moderate intensity, workouts tend to be longer. The defining characteristic, however, is that the intensity level remains relatively unchanged for the duration of the workout. While a steady state workout tends to burn fewer calories per minute than HIIT, this is mostly negated because the workout simply lasts longer. Like HIIT, a steady state workout significantly contributes to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Finland to the Netherlands by bicycle</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/finland_netherlands/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One could say that I grew up cycling. Some of my earlier memories are of me learning to cycle in Purmerend, 20 kilometers or so to the north of Amsterdam. I remember later on trying to break my speed records while checking my speedometer, which at the time (the early 1970s) was a large handlebar mounted contraption. During my teens I road-raced and I have basically enjoyed cycling my whole life. I am proud to say that  technically I have been cycling for about 50 years. So, to answer the question &amp;lsquo;Why cycle?&amp;rsquo;, I can only answer that I know no better. Indeed I know of no better way to physically enjoy myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Make exercise a habit and part of a routine</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/habit_routine/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A habit is something that a person does often, in a regular and repeated way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A routine is a specific set of habits done in a particular order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a regular morning routine could be: wake up, go to the toilet, brush your teeth, get dressed, eat breakfast, drink coffee, go out the door. The whole is a routine, the individual aspects are habits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your days are more or less the same every day, with perhaps some deviation over the weekend, then you have a daily routine. A common one would be: wake up, breakfast, go to work, lunch, more work, go home, dinner, watch TV, go to sleep. Day in, day out&amp;hellip; More specific, however, your daily routine, will consist of multiple shorter routines: morning routine, daytime routine, and evening routine, each containing various habits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I go out and ride</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/how-i-go-out-and-ride/</link>

      <guid>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/how-i-go-out-and-ride/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was born in the &amp;rsquo;60s and grew up in the &amp;rsquo;70s and &amp;rsquo;80s. In other words, I am definitely pre-internet and pre-mobile phones. When I went out to play or ride my bike no-one had a clue as to where I was, and at times neither did I. Imagine going out without notifications from WhatsApp, email, and social media accounts, without GPS-tracking and online maps&amp;hellip; I explored most of the Netherlands with only a physical map in my back pocket. I still like it that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diet or lifestyle change?</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/diet-lifestyle/</link>

      <guid>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/diet-lifestyle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really very simple:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A diet is temporary, a lifestyle change is for ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you are on a diet you &lt;em&gt;temporarily&lt;/em&gt; change your eating habits to achieve a certain outcome - most commonly weight loss - before returning to your previous eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lifestyle change however, consists of adopting healthy overall habits that promote long-term health and weight control. Further more, diets focus on food intake, while lifestyle changes combine what you eat along with other factors that affect your overall health, such as physical activity. Where weight loss is concerned, a diet provides nothing more than a temporary solution and singular approach to a diverse and long-term health issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Motivational quotes</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/quotes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need a bit of motivation. I don&amp;rsquo;t always want to go outside and ride, even knowing that after 20 - 30 minutes I usually can&amp;rsquo;t fathom why I didn&amp;rsquo;t go out earlier. When I need a pick-me-up, I tend to watch a few motivational videos by Jocko Willink and David Goggins telling me to get my shit together and get after it. It works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;arthur-conan-doyle&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Arthur Conan Doyle&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#arthur-conan-doyle&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the spirits are low, when the day appears dark, when work becomes monotonous, when hope hardly seems worth having, just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road, without thought on anything but the ride you are taking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Training zones</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/training-zones/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-training-zones&#34;&gt;&#xA;  What are training zones?&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#what-are-training-zones&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Training zones are basically exercise intensity levels, and the period within each has a direct effect on how productive your training is. Different types of exercises determine for how long you should ideally train within each zone. Simply put, if you are training for endurance then the lower end training zones are your goal, if sudden, high-speed, explosive break-aways are your thing, then you will need to train more often in the higher end training zones. There are several popular methods of determining your training zones, based on heart rate, power, and pace values. But I concentrate only on the heart rate zones, and limit myself to three different methods. In the end it is all about simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Heart rates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowing your heart rate data points is the best way to establish your training zones. However, they are neither easy to define nor to measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;definitions&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Definitions&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#definitions&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate: your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute at any given moment. Heart rates vary from person to person. It’s lower when you’re at rest and higher when you exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rating of Perceived Exertion - RPE</title>
      <link>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/rpe/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ideally you would measure exercise intensity by monitoring your heart rate. However, not everyone has a heart rate monitor readily available. You could measure it by stopping and taking your pulse at regular intervals&amp;hellip;But, there is an alternative that works remarkably well: the Rating of Perceived Exertion, or RPE, also known as the Borg scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Rating of Perceived Exertion is perhaps the most basic way to express the intensity you are experiencing during an exercise, and yet for all its simplicity, it has great value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Cardio?</title>

      <guid>https://ictia.github.io/fi/posts/cardio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simply put, a cardiovascular exercise or cardio is an exercise that elevates your heart and breathing rates - effectively pumps your heart rate up to 60% - 70% of its maximum - for at least 20 minutes, improving your heart, lungs, and circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;types-of-cardio&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Types of Cardio&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#types-of-cardio&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Steady State (SS)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Exercising at a continuous, steady effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Switching between short periods of intense exercise and brief periods of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I come from a cycling nation, so the bicycle is always high on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compared to running, cycling has far less impact on your joints, namely knees and hips, it feels less strenuous yet is a great vehicle for improving your health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cycling relaxes my mind, after a while, and certainly out in the countryside, it wanders off into all kinds of new and interesting directions. A good exercise brings peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
