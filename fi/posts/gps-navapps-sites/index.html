        <p>Cycling has become an increasingly popular form of transportation and exercise. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned pro or just starting out, navigation apps can be a great tool to help you plan and navigate your routes. In this post, I&rsquo;ll take a closer look at some of the cycling navigation apps and sites. The focus is the importing of GPX files, for instance routes downloaded from the Lake Trailsâ€™ website, and on mobile friendly solutions.</p>
<p>But first a bit more about navigation in general. In the world of modern cycling, navigation plays a pivotal role in ensuring a smooth and enjoyable ride. Thanks to advancements in technology, cyclists now have access to a powerful tool known as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). GNSS refers to a network of satellite-based navigation systems that provide precise positioning, navigation, and timing information. By leveraging multiple satellite constellations, including, but not limited to, GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo, GNSS offers cyclists an array of benefits to enhance their riding experiences.</p>
<h2 id="commonly-used-gnss-systems">
  Commonly used GNSS Systems
  <a class="heading-link" href="#commonly-used-gnss-systems">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The primary GNSS system that most cyclists are familiar with is GPS (Global Positioning System), it is a satellite-based navigation system owned and operated by the United States government. It consists of a network of orbiting satellites that transmit signals to GPS receivers on Earth. These receivers then calculate the user&rsquo;s precise location, speed, and time information by analysing the signals received from multiple satellites.</p>
<p>In addition to GPS, there are other global navigation satellite systems, the most well-known of which are: GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema) and Galileo. GLONASS is owned and operated by the Russian Federation, while Galileo is owned and operated by the European Union.</p>
<p>GLONASS operates similarly to GPS, providing global positioning and navigation services. It utilizes a constellation of satellites to transmit signals to receivers, allowing users to determine their precise location.</p>
<p>Galileo, on the other hand, is Europe&rsquo;s independent satellite navigation system. It aims to provide highly accurate positioning, navigation, and timing services to users worldwide. Galileo&rsquo;s constellation of satellites works in conjunction with ground-based control centres and user receivers to enable accurate and reliable navigation.</p>

  Benefits for Cyclists
  <a class="heading-link" href="#benefits-for-cyclists">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The utilization of GNSS systems brings numerous advantages to cyclists, particularly when it comes to navigation and route planning. By harnessing signals from multiple satellite constellations, GNSS-enabled devices, such as dedicated cycling GPS units or smartphones, can offer enhanced accuracy, improved signal reception, and better positioning in challenging environments. This proves invaluable for cyclists exploring unfamiliar territories, riding through dense urban areas, or venturing into remote regions with limited visibility.</p>
<p>The combination of GNSS systems expands the satellite coverage, reducing the likelihood of signal loss or inaccuracies that can occur when relying solely on one system. Cyclists can expect more reliable turn-by-turn directions, precise tracking of routes, and accurate distance and speed measurements. Moreover, the availability of multiple GNSS systems improves resilience against signal interference, allowing for uninterrupted navigation even in areas with obstructed views of the sky.</p>
<p>Additionally, GNSS-enabled devices provide cyclists with a wealth of data and analysis tools. Detailed ride metrics, such as elevation gain, cadence, heart rate, and power output, can be seamlessly integrated with GNSS data to offer comprehensive insights into performance and progress. This data-driven approach empowers cyclists to optimize training, set goals, and monitor improvements over time.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have used all the apps mentioned in this post, as well as many others that are not mentioned, for both testing and data collection purposes. For a long time now, I have used Komoot for planning a route and Locus Map (classic) for tracking that route, in effect the latter is a backup system as I use a dedicated head unit for navigation, recording my rides, and following routes. When I first rode a multi-day ride, I had planned the route via cycle.travel, and opened the resulting GPX file in Locus Map. As I didnâ€™t have a dedicated head unit at the time, I had placed my 20-years old Garmin eTrex on an improvised handlebar holder, and â€˜followedâ€™ the line on the screen. As that device does not have integrated maps, I reverted to my phone, and Locus Map, when needed, specifically in and around more urban areas.</p>
<p>Note that it is important to use cycling navigation apps responsibly. Please do not hold your phone in your hands while cycling and steering with the other hand. This can be very dangerous and increases the risk of accidents. Always remember to stop in a safe place, look at the map or directions, and then continue cycling. As experienced as I am, if I have a need to look at my phone, I still stop, look at the phone, tuck it away again, and only then continue cycling. Your safety and the safety of others on the road is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Allow me to point out that when importing GPX files into some apps and websites, specifically route planning applications, the routes may be adjusted to what the software considers the best option. This can result in some changes to the original route. Please be aware that this is a common feature of GPS routing and navigation systems, and it is intended to provide you with the most accurate and efficient route possible. However, it is important to review the imported route carefully, and adjust where needed, to ensure that it meets your needs and preferences before embarking on your journey. Please use these tools responsibly and always exercise caution and common sense while navigating.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many, many apps and sites to choose from, and I shall focus only on a few, but see these as the starting point for your own journey into finding the method that works best for you.</p>

<p>Google Maps is one of the most widely used GPS mapping solutions on the web, and for good reason. It offers a comprehensive range of features, including turn-by-turn navigation, real-time traffic updates, and a wealth of information about points of interest. Although not directly, Google Maps does allow users to import their own GPX files. And therefore, stands as a relatively simple solution for those who only need this functionality occasionally, who want to use something familiar, and who do not want to install a dedicated application.</p>
<p>To import a GPX file into Google Maps, go to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/" title="Google My Maps">Google My Maps</a> and log in, click on <strong>Create A New Map</strong>, and you can then import a GPX file by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> button and selecting the file from your computer or smartphone. Once imported, you can use Google Maps to view and edit your route. You can also see the route displayed as well as your own relative position to it.</p>
